# Week 5 | Frontend Development

## Introduction 

In simple words, web development is using programming tools and writing codes *tell* a website what to do or how to function. Web Development is the one of the most sought-after field in CS, and a highly paid one as well. Being a developer, you can bring your ideas to life and help others see what you think a better world looks like. Most companies need Developers to develop, maintain and fix their applications &amp; services. Either way, it's a good idea to start learning Development.

## Tasks

### 1. Personal Website

If this is the first time you're learning HTML &amp; CSS, try making a website that has the following features - 
- More than 1 page, with inter-connectivity among pages
- Tables, images, lists
- A seperate stylesheet file with mobile responsive `@media` query, different selectors
- Components of `Boostrap4`

### 2. Counter 

Write a simple script to implement the following:
- The default counter begins at the number 0.
- When you click *Lower Count*, the counter should decrement by 1.  If the count goes below 0, the number should change to the color red.
- When you click *Add Count*, the counter should increment by 1. If the count goes above 0, the number should change to the color green.

### 4. Browser Extension

There are thousands of browser extensions that exist, that run scripts to make your life simpler. Creating extensions is fairly simple, and you could create one to automate something that you regularly do. Head [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) to get started with developing extensions for Google Chrome, you can also look at this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@LindaVivah/the-beginner-s-guide-build-a-simple-chrome-extension-in-minutes-498308ea406a). Although extensions exist for almost everything, you can remake your own as well! Here are some ideas for an extension - 
- Log in to `internet.iitb.ac.in` or `moodle.iitb.ac.in` with one click 
- Block Websites for a certain period of time everyday
- A search bar which opens the top YouTube video recommendation for that keyword 
- Display the total duration of a youtube playlist, given its link
